## Techniques

* Designed and built a **custom reuse mechanism** of infinite scroll view to help reduce the burden of memory.
* Designed a **random generated algorithm** for distributing several custom views on the horizontal scroll view without intersection.
* Built **animation**, **sound effect**, and **haptic vibration** to create an immersive and delightful user experience.
* Worked on **long-press gesture handling** for better archiving experience.
* Created a **reusable alert modal** for error handling in both API managers and view controllers.
* Implemented **user-defined notification** by using User Notifications.
* Utilized **Sign-in with Apple** and Firebase Authentication to carry out the privacy-preserving sign-in flow.
